Introduction\n\nIn the last decade, significant research efforts have focused on the material development of CdTe and CdZnTe, which have become materials of choice in applications such as room-temperature spectroscopic x-ray and gamma-ray semi-conductor detectors. These materials have optimal operable properties from the viewpoint of direct conversion efficiency of incoming radiation by photoelectric effect (high average atomic number $Z \\sim 50$). It is technologically possible to prepare the material as semi-insulating with resistivity $10^9$\u2013$10^{10}$ $\\Omega$ cm by the process of compensation with shallow donors. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature can be kept low due to a relatively high bandgap $E_g$(300 K) $\\approx$ 1.53 eV [1]. The final properties of the detector-grade material are a result of a delicate balance between shallow and deep defects. Relatively small changes of external conditions, especially temperature, can result in substantial modification of trapping and recombination kinetics of free carriers that can be detrimental to charge collection. These changes can be caused not only by standard <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.599,r=0.496,b=0.905), with ID b37e328f-cb02-4c95-b628-917c57c5390b -->\n\ntemperature dependence of trapping and de-trapping of car-\nriers to and from deep levels, but also by thermally induced\nmodifications of surfaces, metal/semiconductor interfaces,\nand defects in the bulk. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.510,t=0.602,r=0.927,b=0.658), with ID ce5c30bb-5452-4e7f-a163-d6ee2594bbc7 -->\n\nLow-temperature annealing performed typically in the\ntemperature range of 373\u2013523 K, as well as its impact on\nproperties of CdTe-based materials and detectors, has been\ninvestigated with controversial results so far. While Wang\net al [2, 3] and Chattopadhyay et al [4] reported increase of\nleakage currents accompanied by deteriorated detection\nparameters, other authors observed decrease of leakage cur-\nrents [5\u20138]. Kim et al [7] studied the influence of the low-\ntemperature annealing in air/vacuum on In/CdZnTe/Au\nsamples with a chemical gold contact and with a gold contact\nformed by evaporation. They showed that the current\ndecreased after the low-temperature annealing (390\u2013410 K)\nin air on the sample with the chemical gold contact due to an\noxide layer creation below the gold contact. The same effect\nwas shown by Mergui et al [8], who measured the effect of\nannealing in air on an Au/CdTe interface.

On the other hand, Park [6]\nshowed that the FWHM is the same before and after low-\ntemperature annealing at about 100$^\\circ$ C for 8 hours. Both used\nthe planar detector configuration, so they did not distinguish\nthe bulk and surface leakage currents, which in turn could\naffect the gamma spectra resolution. Pek\u00e1rek et al measured\nthe passivation influence on detector performance and showed\nimprovement in both the resolution and charge-collection\nefficiency with lower surface leakage current [9]. However,\nthe passivation only affects the surface conditions opposite\nthe low-temperature annealing, which affects the surface and\nthe interface between the semiconductor and metal. In our\nstudy, we focused on very low annealing temperatures, below\n100$^\\circ$ C, to minimize thermal generation of bulk point defects\nthat could act as recombination and trapping centers and\nnegatively influence spectral resolution and charge-collection\nefficiency. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.079,r=0.497,b=0.364), with ID 54cf132b-a35d-44eb-ba82-7e7a897130e7 -->\n\nIn the current study, we provide an insight into the influence of low-temperature annealing in ambient air at even lower temperatures (313\u2013373 K), also covering in detail the temperature range of standard operation conditions of detectors (typically up to 333 K). One of the reasons for observed differences in impact of low-temperature annealing can be the influence of leakage currents flowing on the side surfaces of the sample. These currents strongly depend on the state of the surface, which varies with type of passivation and time. Therefore, we have utilized in this study a guard ring contact structure, which allowed for a separate structure separating bulk and surface leakage currents. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.365,r=0.496,b=0.535), with ID 74fb67d0-a1ae-4604-b765-64437bda19be -->\n\n2. Experiment\n\nThe samples investigated in the study were the detector-grade materials CdTe:In and CdTe:Cl. Their fundamental properties are listed in table 1. The samples\u2019 resistivity was evaluated from I\u2013V curves around 0 V after contact deposition. Gold and Indium were deposited on large opposite sides by evaporation. In this configuration, gold electrode blocks electrons and indium electrode blocks holes, while acting as cathode and anode, respectively. This polarity and high resistivity guarantee a low dark current. The assumed band bending of the Au/CdTe/In structure at 0 V, based on our previous analysis [10], is a negligible bending at the Au/CdTe and In/ CdTe interfaces. The cathode contact was equipped with a guard ring to separate bulk and surface leakage currents during electrical measurements (figure 1). The surfaces were mechanically polished with Al2O3 abrasive (surface RMS 2 nm), without any further chemical treatment. The samples\u2019 n-type conductivity was determined by thermoelectric power measurements [11]. In CdTe:In, the measurement gave a clear signal which referred to n-type conductivity. The CdTe:Cl conductivity measurement had a weak n-type signal, which corresponds to a position of the Fermi level close to the midgap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.563,r=0.495,b=0.904), with ID d3f5a519-feb1-429b-a580-07ab240d7016 -->\n\nSummary : This diagram illustrates the electrical measurement setup for recording current\u2013voltage (I\u2013V) characteristics of a sample using a central electrode, guard ring, and planar electrode.\n\nschematic diagram:\nSetup Overview :\n  \u2022 The sample is sandwiched between a top gold (Au) electrode and a bottom indium (In) planar electrode.\n  \u2022 The top electrode consists of a central electrode and a surrounding guard ring (GR), separated by a 0.4 mm gap.\n  \u2022 The central electrode and guard ring are both made of gold (Au).\n  \u2022 The bottom planar electrode is labeled as indium (In).\n\nElectrical Connections :\n  \u2022 The central electrode is connected to a current path labeled IB.\n  \u2022 The guard ring (GR) is connected to a separate current path labeled IGR.\n  \u2022 The total measured current is ITOT = IB + IGR.\n  \u2022 The planar electrode (In) serves as the common ground or counter electrode.\n\nLabels & Annotations :\n  \u2022 \"SAMPLE\" is the material under test, sandwiched between the electrodes.\n  \u2022 The gap between the central electrode and guard ring is specified as 0.4 mm.\n  \u2022 Arrows indicate the direction of current flow from the electrodes through the sample.\n\nAnalysis :\n  \u2022 The diagram shows a measurement configuration that allows separation of the current flowing through the central electrode (IB) from that through the guard ring (IGR), enabling accurate determination of the sample's I\u2013V characteristics by accounting for edge or leakage currents. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.556,t=0.079,r=0.881,b=0.235), with ID 44a7bbe3-807b-411a-95a1-45eabef94018 -->\n\nThe samples were annealed at temperatures 313\u2013373 K\nwith an annealing step of 10 K in ambient air.

shown in figure 4. This figure also shows an increase of the Schottky barrier height with increasing temperature. The increase starts to be significant at annealing temperatures above 340 K, and is stronger for the CdTe:Cl sample. This concludes that the Schottky barrier increase is responsible for the observed reduction of the bulk current $I_B$ (figure 5). The difference between the barrier height in the CdTe:Cl and CdTe:In as-grown samples approximately corresponds to the position of the Fermi level in these materials. Based on the n-type character of conductivity in both samples, we assume that the limiting Schottky barrier in the presented experiments is the Au/CdTe barrier (table 1). The Schottky barrier increase could be caused by diffusion of oxygen under the gold contact [7]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.076,t=0.604,r=0.495,b=0.846), with ID 066d0d86-6f46-475e-8b05-ad3229f9012f -->\n\nLet us now focus on the leakage current.

This TeO$_2$ effective thickness would correspond to\nthe ellipsometry signal if the surface consisted of only a flat\ntellurium oxide layer. It is apparent that the leakage current\nand TeO$_2$ thickness are well anticorrelated. Therefore, the\nexperimentally observed decrease of the leakage current can\nbe associated with an increasing oxidation of the surface. We\nassume that the surface oxide layer modifies the surface\nleakage channels and/or results in depletion of the surface\nlayer from majority carriers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.144,r=0.928,b=0.285), with ID 2b876ea2-022c-4381-86d2-86638b8da138 -->\n\nThe elemental Te is located on the CdTe surface layer\n[3, 16, 17], and its change is caused by oxidation of the\nsurface and evaporation of Cd. The elemental Te is oxidized\ninto TeO\u2082 [14, 18], which causes a decrease of the Te filling\nfactor in the surface layer. On the other hand, the evaporation\nof cadmium from the CdTe surface [17] increases the Te\nfiling factor, and this is associated with the Te filling factor\nmaximum at about 350 K. The increasing oxide layer causes\nthe growth of the surface roughness. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.292,r=0.927,b=0.420), with ID a7aab5bb-1889-4541-b636-dd3757419f3f -->\n\nWe have estimated the Schottky barrier height error to\nabout 1% due to temperature measurement error (about\n0.1 K), current measurement error (1%), and error from the\nlinear fit (figure 3).

Conclusions\n\nWe have studied the influence of low-temperature annealing in ambient air on detector-grade CdTe:In and CdTe:Cl samples, especially the effect on their surface and bulk properties. We used annealing temperatures in the range where the CdTe detectors normally work. We measured the I\u2013V characteristics and studied the sample surface composition by ellipsometry at room temperature after annealing. Both total current and bulk reverse current decrease after low-temperature annealing in CdTe samples. The total current behavior of the CdTe:Cl and CdTe:In samples agrees with the increase in the surface oxide layer thickness. The decrease of total current was more than 50% after the annealing. The evolution of the bulk current at reverse bias was related to the increase of the Schottky barrier height between metal and semiconductor after the annealing. The Schottky barrier increased from 0.62 to 0.65 eV between gold and CdTe:In, and from 0.68 to 0.72 eV in CdTe:Cl sample. This change had a significant influence on the reverse bulk current, which decreased by more than 50% of its initial value.

      "text": "1. Introduction\n\nIn the last decade, significant research efforts have focused on the material development of CdTe and CdZnTe, which have become materials of choice in applications such as room-temperature spectroscopic x-ray and gamma-ray semi-conductor detectors. These materials have optimal operable properties from the viewpoint of direct conversion efficiency of incoming radiation by photoelectric effect (high average atomic number $Z \\sim 50$). It is technologically possible to prepare the material as semi-insulating with resistivity $10^9$\u2013$10^{10}$ $\\Omega$ cm by the process of compensation with shallow donors. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio at room temperature can be kept low due to a relatively high bandgap $E_g$(300 K) $\\approx$ 1.53 eV [1]. The final properties of the detector-grade material are a result of a delicate balance between shallow and deep defects. Relatively small changes of external conditions, especially temperature, can result in substantial modification of trapping and recombination kinetics of free carriers that can be detrimental to charge collection. These changes can be caused not only by standard",

They showed that the current\ndecreased after the low-temperature annealing (390\u2013410 K)\nin air on the sample with the chemical gold contact due to an\noxide layer creation below the gold contact. The same effect\nwas shown by Mergui et al [8], who measured the effect of\nannealing in air on an Au/CdTe interface. He observed that\noxide penetrates under the contact and leads to a larger barrier",

One of the reasons for observed differences in impact of low-temperature annealing can be the influence of leakage currents flowing on the side surfaces of the sample. These currents strongly depend on the state of the surface, which varies with type of passivation and time. Therefore, we have utilized in this study a guard ring contact structure, which allowed for a separate structure separating bulk and surface leakage currents.",

The samples\u2019 resistivity was evaluated from I\u2013V curves around 0 V after contact deposition. Gold and Indium were deposited on large opposite sides by evaporation. In this configuration, gold electrode blocks electrons and indium electrode blocks holes, while acting as cathode and anode, respectively. This polarity and high resistivity guarantee a low dark current. The assumed band bending of the Au/CdTe/In structure at 0 V, based on our previous analysis [10], is a negligible bending at the Au/CdTe and In/ CdTe interfaces. The cathode contact was equipped with a guard ring to separate bulk and surface leakage currents during electrical measurements (figure 1). The surfaces were mechanically polished with Al2O3 abrasive (surface RMS 2 nm), without any further chemical treatment. The samples\u2019 n-type conductivity was determined by thermoelectric power measurements [11]. In CdTe:In, the measurement gave a clear signal which referred to n-type conductivity. The CdTe:Cl conductivity measurement had a weak n-type signal, which corresponds to a position of the Fermi level close to the midgap.",

This figure also shows an increase of the Schottky barrier height with increasing temperature. The increase starts to be significant at annealing temperatures above 340 K, and is stronger for the CdTe:Cl sample. This concludes that the Schottky barrier increase is responsible for the observed reduction of the bulk current $I_B$ (figure 5). The difference between the barrier height in the CdTe:Cl and CdTe:In as-grown samples approximately corresponds to the position of the Fermi level in these materials. Based on the n-type character of conductivity in both samples, we assume that the limiting Schottky barrier in the presented experiments is the Au/CdTe barrier (table 1). The Schottky barrier increase could be caused by diffusion of oxygen under the gold contact [7].",

Conclusions\n\nWe have studied the influence of low-temperature annealing in ambient air on detector-grade CdTe:In and CdTe:Cl samples, especially the effect on their surface and bulk properties. We used annealing temperatures in the range where the CdTe detectors normally work. We measured the I\u2013V characteristics and studied the sample surface composition by ellipsometry at room temperature after annealing. Both total current and bulk reverse current decrease after low-temperature annealing in CdTe samples. The total current behavior of the CdTe:Cl and CdTe:In samples agrees with the increase in the surface oxide layer thickness. The decrease of total current was more than 50% after the annealing. The evolution of the bulk current at reverse bias was related to the increase of the Schottky barrier height between metal and semiconductor after the annealing. The Schottky barrier increased from 0.62 to 0.65 eV between gold and CdTe:In, and from 0.68 to 0.72 eV in CdTe:Cl sample. This change had a significant influence on the reverse bulk current, which decreased by more than 50% of its initial value. We conclude",
