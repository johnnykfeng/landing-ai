The samplesâ resistivity was evaluated from IâV curves around 0 V after contact deposition. Gold and Indium were deposited on large opposite sides by evaporation. In this configuration, gold electrode blocks electrons and indium electrode blocks holes, while acting as cathode and anode, respectively. This polarity and high resistivity guarantee a low dark current. The assumed band bending of the Au/CdTe/In structure at 0 V, based on our previous analysis [10], is a negligible bending at the Au/CdTe and In/ CdTe interfaces. The cathode contact was equipped with a guard ring to separate bulk and surface leakage currents during electrical measurements (figure 1). The surfaces were mechanically polished with Al2O3 abrasive (surface RMS 2 nm), without any further chemical treatment. The samplesâ n-type conductivity was determined by thermoelectric power measurements [11]. In CdTe:In, the measurement gave a clear signal which referred to n-type conductivity. The CdTe:Cl conductivity measurement had a weak n-type signal, which corresponds to a position of the Fermi level close to the midgap.\n",

      "Answer: The context provided does not include specific details about the main results of the paper. It only mentions the financial support, authors, and references. To determine the main result, one would need to read the full paper itself.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Question: What is the conclusion of the paper?\n",
      "Answer: The conclusion of the paper is that the total current for both CdTe:Cl and CdTe:In decreases with increasing annealing temperature, but CdTe:Cl exhibits a much steeper decline, particularly above 340 K, ultimately nearing zero at 370 K. In contrast, CdTe:In shows a more gradual decrease, maintaining over half its initial current at 370 K. This indicates that CdTe:In is more stable and less sensitive to annealing temperature compared to CdTe:Cl, with the divergence between the two becoming significant at higher temperatures.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Question: How is Schottky barrier formed?\n",
      "Answer: The Schottky barrier is formed at the interface between a metal and a semiconductor when they are brought into contact. This occurs due to the difference in work function between the metal and the semiconductor, leading to the alignment of their energy bands. When the metal is in contact with the n-type semiconductor, electrons from the semiconductor diffuse into the metal, creating a depletion region in the semiconductor and resulting in a potential barrier known as the Schottky barrier. The height of this barrier is influenced by factors such as the type of semiconductor, the metal used, and external conditions like temperature and electric field.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Question: How is Schottky barrier height measured?\n",
      "Answer: The Schottky barrier height is measured using current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, which are analyzed in relation to the applied electric field. The measurements are influenced by factors such as temperature and current measurement errors, as well as the thickness of the material being studied. In this context, the barrier height is determined by observing how it changes with annealing temperature, with data points plotted on a graph and error bars indicating measurement uncertainty.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Question: How is Te02 thickness measured?\n",
      "Answer: TeOâ thickness is measured using variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry, specifically with a commercial JA Woollam Co. RC2 ellipsometer. The measurements are taken in reflection mode at three incident angles (55Â°, 60Â°, and 65Â°) and analyzed using CompleteEASE software, applying predefined models for TeOâ from the Woollam database.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Question: How does Te02 thickness the performance of the detector?\n",
      "Answer: The thickness of TeOâ can significantly impact the performance of the detector by influencing factors such as surface roughness, charge collection efficiency, and overall material quality. In the context of the provided data, as the thickness of TeOâ varies, it is associated with changes in the percentage of tellurium and surface roughness, which can affect the electrical properties of the CdTe:In material.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Surface Quality**: Increased TeOâ thickness may lead to higher surface roughness, which can introduce additional scattering and trapping sites for charge carriers, potentially degrading the detector's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Charge Carrier Dynamics**: The presence of TeOâ can influence the trapping and recombination kinetics of free carriers. A thicker layer may alter the electric field distribution at the surface, affecting how efficiently charge carriers are collected.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Material Stability**: Variations in TeOâ thickness can also affect the stability of the detector material under operational conditions, impacting long-term performance and reliability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, optimizing TeOâ thickness is crucial for achieving the best detector performance, balancing surface quality and charge carrier dynamics to minimize noise and maximize signal integrity.\n",
