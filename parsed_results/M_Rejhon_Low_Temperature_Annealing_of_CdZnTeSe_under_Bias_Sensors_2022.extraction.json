We observed significant changes in the detector’s resistance and space-charge accumulation. This could potentially lead to the control and improvement of the electronic properties of the detector because the changes are accompanied with the reduction in the bulk dark current and surface leakage current. In this article, we present the results of a detailed study of the internal electric field and conductivity changes in CdZnTeSe detector for various annealing steps under bias taking into account different polarities during annealing and subsequent characterization. We observed that low-temperature annealing results in an increase in the barrier height at the contacts that, in general, reduces the dark current and decreases the positive space charge present in the sample compared to the pre-annealed condition. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.273,t=0.299,r=0.945,b=0.455), with ID ac0cefa8-5135-47a1-888f-4e0f0724fc34 -->\n\n**Keywords:** CdZnTeSe; radiation detector; electrodes; low-temperature annealing; space charge <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.275,t=0.468,r=0.914,b=0.486), with ID ccf9f7a0-33be-4bd1-9051-9aa162334190 -->\n\nlogo: check for updates\n\n**Citation:** Rejhon, M.; Dedic, V.; Grill, R.; Franc, J.; Roy, U.N.; James, R.B.

Introduction  \n    CdZnTeSe (CZTS) material has been under development for hard X-ray and gamma-ray semiconductor detectors [1–3]. It was observed that the addition of Se to the CdZnTe (CZT) matrix provides improved compositional homogeneity and mitigates many performance-limiting defects [4]. The CZTS material exhibits comparable or even better electrical and spectroscopic properties as CdTe and CZT materials [1,5–10]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.276,t=0.528,r=0.946,b=0.621), with ID 87c59bb7-a9b6-4e26-ab2f-48fef02dcfa5 -->\n\nCdTe-based detectors can be annealed in different atmospheres to improve the electrical and spectroscopic properties. Low-temperature annealing is typically performed on CdTe-based materials in the temperature range of 370–520 K. Studies investigating the influence of low-temperature annealing on CdTe/CdZnTe material have reported controversial results [11–15]. However, these studies were performed on samples with planar electrodes, which do not allow the investigators to distinguish between bulk and surface leakage currents. This is necessary for separating the change in metal/semiconductor interface and surface conditions. Our recent study demonstrated the influence of low-temperature annealing on the surface leakage current and bulk current, especially on the Schottky barrier height [16]. The sample was treated with temperatures between 313 K up to 373 K in ambient air. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.276,t=0.621,r=0.945,b=0.783), with ID 37b2e486-ea77-4b6f-a916-f629d40ce254 -->\n\nAnother method used to change the detector properties of CdTe-based materials is electromigration. Here, the charged defects drift in an external electric field. Kim et al. [17] showed the improvement in the mobility-lifetime product after the treatment of CZT at 493 K at a voltage of 60 V for 7 and 60 days, which they assigned to the electromigration of Cu, Fe, and Ga impurities. Additional studies demonstrated the electromigration of positively charged donors in CdTe-based materials, which mainly affect the electrical properties [18–20]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.276,t=0.785,r=0.944,b=0.889), with ID ff8a1c3e-4b4a-4cf5-8c25-89571d8fb42b -->\n\nIn this article, we provide the results of the annealing of CZTS performed at standard\noperating conditions of detectors to analyze their potential impact on the material and <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.277,t=0.889,r=0.944,b=0.921), with ID 37cb496e-308b-4a2a-bae6-6ef539967ead -->\n\n*Sensors* **2022**, 22, 171. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22010171 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.968,r=0.401,b=0.985), with ID 56ce5085-0f76-4fb0-b52a-c2df2fba0720 -->\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.687,t=0.969,r=0.944,b=0.985), with ID 3cf4eb32-cdfe-4c0d-88b9-ad9981eead44 -->\n\n*Sensors* **2022**, 22, 171 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.063,r=0.183,b=0.080), with ID 12298ac9-aabb-4047-98a6-648ca40ec4db -->\n\n2 of 10 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.895,t=0.063,r=0.944,b=0.079), with ID d99cef35-325f-4bee-acbd-0cf1e9741a75 -->\n\ncontact characteristics.

Materials and Methods\n\nWe studied a CZTS sample with 4% Se and 10% Zn. The sample was cut from a CZTS ingot, which was grown by the traveling heater method with doping of In in the ppm range. The sample dimensions were 5.35 × 4.60 × 1.90 mm³. Al₂O₃ abrasive was used to mechanically polish the sample surface (surface RMS 2 nm) without any further chemical treatment. The metal electrodes were evaporated on the large opposite sides. One contact was planarly made from indium. The opposite gold contact consisted of a guard ring and a central electrode, which allowed us to separate the bulk and surface leakage currents. The area of the central electrode was 2.4 × 2.4 mm². It was separated from the guard ring electrode covering the rest of the surface by a 500 μm wide gap. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.274,t=0.214,r=0.945,b=0.367), with ID 2a2d7b7e-d236-4037-bc84-74beeae922b3 -->\n\nFor low-temperature annealing of the CZTS and its characterization, the sample was mounted in an optical cryostat equipped with fine temperature regulation using a Peltier device. An argon atmosphere was maintained in the cryostat at all times. The setup allowed the characterization of the sample between annealing steps without any further manipulation. Before annealing, the as-grown sample was characterized by I–V and electric field (Pockels) measurements (step 0). Each annealing step was conducted in the following way: the sample temperature was stabilized to the required value. Then, a bias of 700 V (with the respective polarity of the indium electrode) was applied for 60 min using a Keithley 2410 source meter. Individual annealing steps were performed for both voltage polarities. The temperature of the annealing steps was increased by 10 K in the range of 320–360 K. Electronic properties were measured after each step at 300 K. A scheme of gradual experimental steps over time is shown in Figure 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.275,t=0.368,r=0.944,b=0.548), with ID f649443d-44b5-426a-9d30-a239618d8dce -->\n\nSummary : This bar chart presents the temperature conditions and sequence of experimental steps during a study involving annealing and characterization of a sample, with alternating bias polarities and specific temperature setpoints.\n\nbar chart:\n# Title & Axes :\n  • No explicit title on the chart, but the context is \"Time scheme of experimental steps.\"\n  • X-axis: \"Gradual experimental steps over time\" with tick labels 0 to 10.\n  • Y-axis: \"Temperature (K)\" ranging from 300 to 360 K, with tick marks at 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, and 360.\n  • Each x-tick represents a sequential experimental step, starting from \"as-grown\" (step 0).\n\n# Data Points :\n  • Three series are shown:\n    – \"60 min annealing at (+)700 V, In anode\" (cyan with crosshatch pattern)\n    – \"60 min annealing at (-)700 V, In cathode\" (yellow with diagonal lines)\n    – \"characterization at 300 K (I–V & Pockels)\" (solid beige)\n  • Stepwise temperature values (from bar tops and labels):\n    | Step | Annealing (+700 V) | Annealing (–700 V) | Characterization |\n    |------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n    | 0    | —                  | —                  | as-grown         |\n    | 1    | 320 K              | —                  | 300 K            |\n    | 2    | —                  | 320 K              | 300 K            |\n    | 3    | 330 K              | —                  | 300 K            |\n    | 4    | —                  | 330 K              | 300 K            |\n    | 5    | 340 K              | —                  | 300 K            |\n    | 6    | —                  | 340 K              | 300 K            |\n    | 7    | 350 K              | —                  | 300 K            |\n    | 8    | —                  | 350 K              | 300 K            |\n    | 9    | 360 K              | —                  | 300 K            |\n    | 10   | —                  | 360 K              | 300 K            |\n\n# Design Encodings :\n  • Cyan crosshatch bars for (+)700 V annealing steps.\n  • Yellow diagonal-line bars for (–)700 V annealing steps.\n  • Beige solid bars for characterization at 300 K.\n  • Numeric temperature labels above each annealing bar.\n  • Legend in upper left corner with pattern and colour keys.\n\n# Distribution & Trends :\n  • Annealing steps alternate between (+)700 V and (–)700 V, with temperature increasing in 10 K increments from 320 K to 360 K.\n  • Characterization steps always at 300 K, interleaved after each annealing step.\n  • No annealing at step 0; this is the as-grown sample.\n\n# Analysis :\n  • The experiment alternates annealing polarity and increases temperature in discrete steps, with each annealing followed by a characterization at 300 K.\n  • The temperature for annealing rises from 320 K to 360 K in 10 K increments, while characterization temperature remains constant.\n  • The design allows for systematic study of the effects of both temperature and electric field polarity on the sample, with clear separation of annealing and measurement conditions. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.275,t=0.555,r=0.942,b=0.749), with ID 7bac7185-5fc6-434e-9fc2-9292fd69323b -->\n\nFor the characterization at 300 K, the CZTS sample was biased by a Keithley 2410 source\nmeter, and I–V curves were measured by two Keithley 2000 multimeters (bulk and leakage\ncurrents) in the range of ±800 V.

The positive space charge formed in the biased semiconductor may be, in general, induced either by an injecting anode or a blocking cathode. Injecting an anode is increasing the concentration of holes that can be trapped at deep levels. This way a positive space charge in the bulk can be formed. Another possibility to form a positive space charge is to use a blocking cathode. In this case, electrons are depleted in the bulk, and an uncompensated fixed space charge is present in the volume of the sample. In our case, we may reject the injection of holes. The I–V characteristics displayed in Figure 3a clearly show the S-character proving the blocking contact. Moreover, the almost perfectly linear profiles of the electric field in Figure 2 sign the charging by carrier depletion. On the other hand, the carrier injection would produce curves deviating from linear profiles as predicted by the theory of the Space Charge Limited Currents [23,24]. Consequently, the blocking cathode may be considered as the primary attribute responsible for the positive space charge formation in the sample before annealing—step 0. Since the same features are observed for both positive and negative biasing, we may conclude that both contacts, Au and In, act in the same way. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.273,t=0.111,r=0.945,b=0.351), with ID 2a688366-f698-4c00-bb87-1d1a2991d9e9 -->\n\nLet us now focus on the evolution of the resistance and space charge with the annealing\nsteps—Figures 2c,d and 3c and Table 1. We can see that the annealing steps resulting in\nthe resistance increase are accompanied by a space charge reduction. This situation may\nbe then unambiguously explained as the enhancement of the blocking character of the\nanode inducing the hole depletion. The electrical current is smaller and the resistance is\nhigher due to the reduction of the hole component. At the same time, a smaller hole current\nresults in a smaller hole trapping at deep levels. This way the positive space charge in\nthe bulk is reduced. A scheme representing the above-mentioned processes is shown in\nFigure 5. Figure 5a,b represent the conditions in the sample after annealing steps 5 and 6,\nrespectively. A scheme representing the processes leading to this situation is presented as a\nchange between Figure 5a,b that represents the conditions in the sample after annealing\nsteps 5 and 6, respectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.275,t=0.352,r=0.944,b=0.530), with ID c7f23523-8749-4f3c-88ee-50f0d033807e -->\n\nThe interpretation of the effect of the annealing steps resulting in the increase in the\npositive space charge is more complex. The increased cathode blocking or reduced anode\nblocking may result in the desired effect. That would, however, contradict the observed\nnearly unchanged specific resistivity evaluated from the slopes of the I–V characteristics at\na bias close to 0—Figure 4. We thus conclude that this situation can be explained by the\nparallel activity of both mechanisms when the increased resistance caused by enhanced\ncathode blocking is compensated by reduced resistance due to lowered anode blocking.

The calculations were done with the homemade code [23,25] solving the drift-diffusion and Poisson’s equations. We defined the defect structure of the bulk by trial parameters: Fermi energy $E_F = E_c - 0.725$ eV, one electron trap with the density $N_{te} = 3 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ localized below $E_F$ at the energy $E_{te} = E_c - 0.79$ eV, and one hole trap above $E_F$ with the density $N_{th} = 3 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the energy $E_{th} = E_c - 0.66$ eV. Since we investigated only the steady state here, the respective capture cross sections cannot be determined [23]. The effect of the annealing was simulated by tuning transfer rates $\\gamma$ defining the source of carriers in both contacts [23]. We used flat bands at the simulations since the information on the band bending is not accessible. Besides, the respective band bending may be compensated by appropriate tuning of the transfer rates so that it does not disable the simulation. <!-- text, from page 0

It allows us to easily demarcate the maximum particular current conforming simultaneously to the zero electric current at zero bias. Evidently, a realistic model of contacts would have to be described by a much more complex theory. For such specification, we do not have enough experimental data, and the detailed contact properties investigation was not the primary aim of the research. The visualization of the fitted $\\gamma$ is more convenient in the inverted form $\\gamma^{-1}$ since it corresponds to the blocking character of the interface barriers. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.275,t=0.670,r=0.944,b=0.790), with ID 291d3fe8-1d80-4119-9442-e3c431a27f3a -->\n\nWe plot in Figure 6a,b the results of the simulations of the charge and resistance, respectively.

We can see that, in agreement with the suggested model, the polarization is more ruled by the evolution of barriers blocking holes (solid connecting lines). In case of electrons, the effect is less distinctive (dashed connecting lines). Nevertheless, the evolution of barriers blocking electrons has a dominant effect on the space charge tuning. In the negative electric field (see Figure 2b), the electron barrier at the In contact remains stable, and the ascending barrier of holes on Au leads to the reduction in the polarization.

During annealing, when the particular electrode is positive, its ability to block both types of carriers increases. If the electrode during annealing is negative, its ability to block holes decreases, while its ability to block electrons does not change. Observed changes show signs of universality because the effects do not depend on whether the electrode is indium or gold. By suitable tuning and a combination of conditions of low-temperature annealing under bias (temperature and polarity) and polarity used during the detector operation, its resistance can be significantly increased, and the effect of positive-space-charge accumulation on the traps can be reduced. In addition, it appears advantageous to anneal the sample at a temperature of at least 350 K, at which there is a significant reduction in the surface current, as can be seen in Figure 3b. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.274,t=0.486,r=0.943,b=0.709), with ID 0caff0ed-6036-4776-89a2-c075b50307bd -->\n\nWe assumed that the modification of the barriers at the contacts after low-temperature annealing could be explained by the development of an insulation layer between the semiconductor and metal electrodes. The difference between an expected I–V behavior based on the work function model and our observations can be attributed to a thin interfacial layer between the semiconductor and metallic electrodes. Although there is no source of oxygen during the annealing and characterisation processes, we expect the presence of a-few-nm thick oxide (TeO₂) layer at the CZTS surface before contact deposition, which could slightly develop (change its thickness vs. concentration) during annealing and therefore affect the barrier’s electronic properties. We reported the initial presence of a 2.8 nm thick TeO₂ layer at the CZTS surface with a concentration of 66% recently in the [16] estimated by ellipsometry measurements and analysis performed on the sample with the similar surface treatment. If there is a significantly thick interfacial layer with a reasonably high density of states, the Fermi level is pinned by the surface states, and the barrier height is independent of the metal workfunction, and it is given by the surface properties as mentioned in the [26]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.276,t=0.711,r=0.943,b=0.918), with ID 5d825435-9b3e-4337-a055-d7fc1db7380d -->\n\n*Sensors* **2022, 22, 171** <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.055,t=0.063,r=0.183,b=0.080), with ID b9290a6b-d292-4071-955c-0eeff5069e2d -->\n\n9 of 10 <!-- marginalia, from page 0 (l=0.895,t=0.063,r=0.944,b=0.079), with ID 3520b073-f7a6-4da6-8c27-2428f3b00d1f -->\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nWe investigated the influence of low-temperature annealing under an applied bias on the basic electrical properties of the detector-grade material CdZnTeSe. We treated the CZTS sample with temperatures in the range where detectors normally work from 320 K to 360 K, and with a normal detector bias voltage (±700 V). We measured the internal electric field profiles and I–V characteristics after each annealing step. We observed that the profiles of the internal electric field and the total space charge density evaluated at room temperature are influenced by both the temperature and polarity of the applied bias during annealing. We analyzed the I–V characteristics measured at room temperature after each annealing step and evaluated the specific resistivity of the bulk and resistance at ±600 V. We could identify correlations between the charge and resistance changes. We explained the experimental data by a qualitative model based on the modification of the contact barriers by annealing. Low-temperature annealing of the contacts under bias can be used to modify the contact properties. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.272,t=0.112,r=0.946,b=0.327), with ID c0b28b13-8ea0-40a2-b1a6-b0de2986780d -->\n\n**Author Contributions:** M.R., V.D. and J.F. proposed the idea of the annealing of CZTS detector under bias.

      "text": "**Abstract:** We performed a gradual low-temperature annealing up to 360 K on a CdZnTeSe radiation detector equipped with gold and indium electrodes under bias at both polarities. We observed significant changes in the detector’s resistance and space-charge accumulation. This could potentially lead to the control and improvement of the electronic properties of the detector because the changes are accompanied with the reduction in the bulk dark current and surface leakage current. In this article, we present the results of a detailed study of the internal electric field and conductivity changes in CdZnTeSe detector for various annealing steps under bias taking into account different polarities during annealing and subsequent characterization. We observed that low-temperature annealing results in an increase in the barrier height at the contacts that, in general, reduces the dark current and decreases the positive space charge present in the sample compared to the pre-annealed condition.",

Low-temperature annealing is typically performed on CdTe-based materials in the temperature range of 370–520 K. Studies investigating the influence of low-temperature annealing on CdTe/CdZnTe material have reported controversial results [11–15]. However, these studies were performed on samples with planar electrodes, which do not allow the investigators to distinguish between bulk and surface leakage currents. This is necessary for separating the change in metal/semiconductor interface and surface conditions. Our recent study demonstrated the influence of low-temperature annealing on the surface leakage current and bulk current, especially on the Schottky barrier height [16]. The sample was treated with temperatures between 313 K up to 373 K in ambient air.",

Al₂O₃ abrasive was used to mechanically polish the sample surface (surface RMS 2 nm) without any further chemical treatment. The metal electrodes were evaporated on the large opposite sides. One contact was planarly made from indium. The opposite gold contact consisted of a guard ring and a central electrode, which allowed us to separate the bulk and surface leakage currents.

Before annealing, the as-grown sample was characterized by I–V and electric field (Pockels) measurements (step 0). Each annealing step was conducted in the following way: the sample temperature was stabilized to the required value. Then, a bias of 700 V (with the respective polarity of the indium electrode) was applied for 60 min using a Keithley 2410 source meter. Individual annealing steps were performed for both voltage polarities. The temperature of the annealing steps was increased by 10 K in the range of 320–360 K.

      "text": "In semi-insulating semiconductors, both electrons and holes participate in the transport. The positive space charge formed in the biased semiconductor may be, in general, induced either by an injecting anode or a blocking cathode. Injecting an anode is increasing the concentration of holes that can be trapped at deep levels. This way a positive space charge in the bulk can be formed. Another possibility to form a positive space charge is to use a blocking cathode. In this case, electrons are depleted in the bulk, and an uncompensated fixed space charge is present in the volume of the sample. In our case, we may reject the injection of holes. The I–V characteristics displayed in Figure 3a clearly show the S-character proving the blocking contact. Moreover, the almost perfectly linear profiles of the electric field in Figure 2 sign the charging by carrier depletion. On the other hand, the carrier injection would produce curves deviating from linear profiles as predicted by the theory of the Space Charge Limited Currents [23,24]. Consequently, the blocking cathode may be considered as the primary attribute responsible for the positive space charge formation in the sample before annealing—step 0. Since the same features are observed for both positive and negative biasing, we may conclude that both contacts, Au and In, act in the same way.",

The calculations were done with the homemade code [23,25] solving the drift-diffusion and Poisson’s equations. We defined the defect structure of the bulk by trial parameters: Fermi energy $E_F = E_c - 0.725$ eV, one electron trap with the density $N_{te} = 3 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ localized below $E_F$ at the energy $E_{te} = E_c - 0.79$ eV, and one hole trap above $E_F$ with the density $N_{th} = 3 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the energy $E_{th} = E_c - 0.66$ eV. Since we investigated only the steady state here, the respective capture cross sections cannot be determined [23]. The effect of the annealing was simulated by tuning transfer rates $\\gamma$ defining the source of carriers in both contacts [23]. We used flat bands at the simulations since the information on the band bending is not accessible. Besides, the respective band bending may be compensated by appropriate tuning of the transfer rates so that it does not disable the simulation.",

      "text": "The effects of low temperature annealing up to 360 K of the biased semi-insulating CZTS can be summarized as the following: The bulk material resistivity remains practically unchanged, while major changes affecting the electronic properties of the detector, such as the total space charge and dark current at high voltage bias (therefore, the resistance at ±600 V) under which the detectors work by default, are associated with the development of surface states under the electrodes. During annealing, when the particular electrode is positive, its ability to block both types of carriers increases. If the electrode during annealing is negative, its ability to block holes decreases, while its ability to block electrons does not change. Observed changes show signs of universality because the effects do not depend on whether the electrode is indium or gold. By suitable tuning and a combination of conditions of low-temperature annealing under bias (temperature and polarity) and polarity used during the detector operation, its resistance can be significantly increased, and the effect of positive-space-charge accumulation on the traps can be reduced. In addition, it appears advantageous to anneal the sample at a temperature of at least 350 K, at which there is a significant reduction in the surface current, as can be seen in Figure 3b.",

      "text": "We assumed that the modification of the barriers at the contacts after low-temperature annealing could be explained by the development of an insulation layer between the semiconductor and metal electrodes. The difference between an expected I–V behavior based on the work function model and our observations can be attributed to a thin interfacial layer between the semiconductor and metallic electrodes. Although there is no source of oxygen during the annealing and characterisation processes, we expect the presence of a-few-nm thick oxide (TeO₂) layer at the CZTS surface before contact deposition, which could slightly develop (change its thickness vs. concentration) during annealing and therefore affect the barrier’s electronic properties. We reported the initial presence of a 2.8 nm thick TeO₂ layer at the CZTS surface with a concentration of 66% recently in the [16] estimated by ellipsometry measurements and analysis performed on the sample with the similar surface treatment. If there is a significantly thick interfacial layer with a reasonably high density of states, the Fermi level is pinned by the surface states, and the barrier height is independent of the metal workfunction, and it is given by the surface properties as mentioned in the [26].",

We treated the CZTS sample with temperatures in the range where detectors normally work from 320 K to 360 K, and with a normal detector bias voltage (±700 V). We measured the internal electric field profiles and I–V characteristics after each annealing step. We observed that the profiles of the internal electric field and the total space charge density evaluated at room temperature are influenced by both the temperature and polarity of the applied bias during annealing. We analyzed the I–V characteristics measured at room temperature after each annealing step and evaluated the specific resistivity of the bulk and resistance at ±600 V. We could identify correlations between the charge and resistance changes. We explained the experimental data by a qualitative model based on the modification of the contact barriers by annealing. Low-temperature annealing of the contacts under bias can be used to modify the contact properties.",
